                  <p>MerchantHaus acts as a technology facilitator and intermediary. We are not a bank or a licensed financial institution. We facilitate the processing of payments through our relationships with third-party acquiring banks and Card Networks.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">4.2 Fees</h3>
                  <p>You agree to pay the fees, charges, and other assessments (collectively, "Fees") applicable to your use of the Services, which will be disclosed to you during onboarding or in a separate signed agreement. All Fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise specified. Fees are non-refundable unless explicitly stated otherwise. We reserve the right to change our Fees with thirty (30) days' prior notice.</p>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">4.3 Payment of Fees</h3>
                  <p>Fees will typically be deducted from the settlement funds due to you from your processed transactions. If settlement funds are insufficient, or for any other charges due, you authorize MerchantHaus to debit your designated bank account on file.</p>

                    <li>You are solely and fully liable for the total amount of all Chargebacks, refunds, retrievals, and any associated fees (including Card Network fees and MerchantHaus administrative fees).</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for managing your own customer service and providing refunds to your customers as per your business policies.</li>
                    <li>MerchantHaus is not responsible for handling customer service for your business or issuing refunds on your behalf, though we provide the tools to facilitate them.</li>
                    <li>In the event of a Chargeback, you agree to cooperate with MerchantHaus and provide all necessary information and documentation within the required timeframe.</li>

                  <p>MerchantHaus reserves the right to establish a "Reserve" â€” a portion of your settlement funds held by us to cover potential future losses from Chargebacks, refunds, or other liabilities. We may establish or change the terms of your Reserve at any time based on our assessment of the risk associated with your account or business.</p>

                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">4.6 Payouts (Settlements)</h3>
                  <p>MerchantHaus will settle funds from processed transactions to your designated bank account, less our Fees, any Chargebacks, refunds, and Reserve amounts, according to the payout schedule agreed upon. Payouts may be delayed by us or our partners for risk management, compliance, or investigative purposes.</p>
